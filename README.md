# Paddle Billing Plugin for aMember Pro

Paddle Billing is the evolution of Paddle Classic, and is the default billing API for Paddle accounts created after August 8th, 2023.

If you signed up for Paddle before this date, [you need to opt-in](https://developer.paddle.com/changelog/2023/enable-paddle-billing) to Paddle Billing. After you opt in, you can toggle between Paddle Billing and Paddle Classic, and run the two side by side for as long as you need.
